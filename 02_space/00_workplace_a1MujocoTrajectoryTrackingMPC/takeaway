<take way>
- openGL stuff warnimg "undefined reference to `glGetString'" that is library include fail
- move all .o extension file "rm *.o"
- object file created by macos is not suitable for linux
- macos app library downloaded from homebrew cant be used in linux like nlopt.app
- unveil the software installation
	nlopt installnation
		1, install the package from official website (https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
		2, follow the install instruction (https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Installation/)
		3, create symbolic link (ln -s /path/ /path/) for library and header file
- the makefile including library is different from mac to linux mac like "LDFLAGS" linux like "-w -lnlopt ../bin/libnlopt.so"
- the minimum format to use nlopt in linux (need to be arranged later)
